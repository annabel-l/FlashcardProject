# FlashcardProject
This is a flashcard app that supports the dynamic creation and deletion of flashcards and flashcard sets utilizing Django. Users can login and register with a username and password, where their previously made flashcard sets will appear and can be accessed and added to/deleted from. Certain sets can be marked as important, and a drop down menu sorts the sets alphabetically, by date created, or by importance. The type of sort will also be maintained throughout the session unless changed. Additionally, there is a tag that will display for each card set (can be used to store subject, class, etc.) and a search bar that allows you to search for a set by its name or tag name.
